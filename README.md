# Model checker (Work in progress)

Prototype of a explicit state model checker based upon the Scala ExecutionContext.

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker)

This project is separated into four sub projects:
* *futures* contains a model checker for scala Futures and their ExecutionContext
* *scalaz* contains a model checker for scalaz-io (coming soon)
* *akka* contains a model checker for Akka (also coming soon)
* *benchmarks* helps to justify performance sensitive decisions

Use `sbt test` to execute all tests.
Notice that example code snippets from scaladoc with [sbt-example](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/sbt-example) are used to test functionality.
For those tests ScalaTest with Matchers is used.

An example:

```scala
/**
  * @example My little object. 
  * {{{
  *   MyObject.x should be(1)
  * }}}
  */
object MyObject {
  val x = 1
}
```

## Documentation

The main source of information is currently the api-documentation generated by scaladoc.
