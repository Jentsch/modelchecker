# Model checker (Work in progress)

[Website](http://jentsch.berlin/modelchecker/latest/api/ecspec/index.html)

Prototype of a explicit state model checker based upon the Scala ExecutionContext.

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker)

Use `sbt test` to execute all tests. Notice that the code snippets from scaladoc are used to test functionality. For those tests ScalaTest with FlatSpec an Matchers is used.

An example:

```scala
/**
  * My little class. 
  * {{{
  *   MyClass.x should be(1)
  * }}}
  */
object MyObject {
  val x = 1
}
```

## Documentation

The website is mostly generated by the test files in /src/test/scala/. index.scala generates initial landing page. Use `sbt previewSite` to see a assembled preview. With `ghpagesPushSite` the result can be uploaded.
