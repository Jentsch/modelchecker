# Model checker (Work in progress)

[Website](http://jentsch.berlin/modelchecker/)

Prototype of a explicit state model checker based upon the Scala ExecutionContext.

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jentsch/modelchecker)

This is a plain sbt project. Use `sbt test` to execute all tests.

## Documentation

The website is mostly generated by the test files in /src/test/scala/. index.scala generates initial landing page. Use `sbt previewSite` to see a assembled preview. With `ghpagesPushSite` the result can be uploaded.
